# Development Standards

Follow 12-factor app methodology for all development:

- **Config**: Store all config in environment variables, never hardcode
- **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare all dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- **Backing services**: Treat databases, queues, and APIs as attached resources via env vars
- **Build/run separation**: Keep build, release, and run stages distinct
- **Processes**: App is stateless — no sticky sessions, no local file storage
- **Port binding**: Export services via port binding, not web server injection
- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams (stdout/stderr only, never write to files)
- **Dev/prod parity**: Keep environments as similar as possible
